Key Takaways: My key takeways for this exercise is that it's a great refresher of what we already have previously learned about HTML and CSS in our CMSC 12, with the addition of the concept of flexboxes today. It's also cool that we got to create a portfolio of our works, giving us a glimpse of how it will look like to actually apply for software related jobs and show them our website portfolio. It's also great that we're getting more and more used to using Git and Github by submitting our exercises here instead of Google Classroom. Also, it's great to know how to use Github Pages as it's my first time to use this, it's cool that it immediately gives you a link for your static website. All in all, this exercise shows how web programming actually happens in the real world.
